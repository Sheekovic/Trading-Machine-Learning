# Crypto Price Prediction Bot

The **Crypto Price Prediction Bot** is a Telegram bot designed to predict the prices of cryptocurrencies using historical data from the Binance exchange. It leverages machine learning models to analyze data and generate price predictions for the next 30 days, along with interactive visualizations.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Crypto Price Prediction Bot, you need to set up a Telegram bot and install the necessary Python packages. Follow these steps:

1. Create a Telegram bot by following the instructions in the [Telegram Bot API documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).
2. Copy the bot token generated by BotFather.
3. Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

## Usage

1. Start the bot by running the Python script:
2. Open your Telegram app and search for your bot.
3. Send the `/start` command to the bot to initiate the conversation.
4. Send the `/predict` command to the bot.
5. Enter the symbol of the cryptocurrency you want to predict (e.g., BTCUSDT).
6. The bot will process the data, train the models, and generate price predictions.
7. The bot will send you a CSV file containing the predictions for the next 30 days.
8. **Download CSV File**: The bot will send you a CSV file containing the predictions for the next 30 days.
9. **View Interactive Graphs**: The bot will also generate interactive graphs displaying the predictions from different models.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval**: Fetches historical price data from the Binance exchange.
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleans and processes the data by calculating RSI, Moving Average, and MACD indicators.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Trains multiple models including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and Ridge regression.
- **Price Prediction**: Predicts prices for the next 30 days based on historical data.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Uses Plotly to create interactive plots for a more engaging user experience.
